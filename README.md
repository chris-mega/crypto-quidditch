# CryptoQuidditch
This is originally a project for COMP3010 - "Distributed Computing" at the [University of Manitoba](https://www.sci.umanitoba.ca/cs/). This is my exploration of how to implement a dapp in Ethereum (understanding non-fungible tokens, writing smart contracts, calling them in frontend and deploying)

## About
Inspired in the sport created by J.K. Rowling, you can collect and sell cards of famous fictional quidditch players. There are two main types of cards: **Cannon** (existing in the books, movies and fan pages) and **Non-Cannon** (created by me). Each player will also be classified by category depending on the highest rank they achieved (e.g. World Class, school league).

## Main libraries used
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (used v12.16.2)
- [Truffle](https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle)
- [React.js](https://reactjs.org/)
- [OpenZeppelin](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts)
- [Web3.js](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/v1.2.9/index.html)

## Ethereum setup
- Install a wallet in your browser like [Metamask](https://metamask.io/)
- Use [Ganache](https://www.trufflesuite.com/ganache) for running in a dev environment

## Install
```
npm install
```
## Run
```
npm start
```
